# Pipeline Overview

**ssaTranscribe** is an audio-to-text transcription pipeline built from open-source, self-hosted tools to transcribe original _Sesame Street_ episodes and support the expansion of the _Sesame Street_ Archive (SSA). Its capabilities include multilingual transcription, keyword detection, speaker diarization, and voice matching.

## Key Aims (Jul. - Dec. 2025)
`ssaTranscribe` is an audio-to-text pipeline designed to generate full-episode transcriptions for 4,397 original _Sesame Street_ episodes, enabling new ways to analyze and manage the content behind the _Sesame Street_ Archive (SSA). Its primary goal is to support the SSAâ€™s expansion from ~5,000 to 35,000 labeled images featuring four target object categories (`face`, `number`, `place`, `word`). By surfacing descriptive language from episode dialogue, `ssaTranscribe` will help to curate visually imaginative, stylistically diverse scenes that reflect children's experiences of wonder, play, and interactive learning.
