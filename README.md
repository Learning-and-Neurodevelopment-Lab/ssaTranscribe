# Pipeline Overview

**ssaTranscribe** is an audio-to-text transcription pipeline built from open-source, self-hosted tools to transcribe original _Sesame Street_ episodes and support the expansion of the _Sesame Street_ Archive (SSA). Its capabilities include multilingual transcription, keyword detection, speaker diarization, and voice matching.

## Key Aims (Jul. - Dec. 2025)

By generating searchable transcripts of 4,397 _Sesame Street_ episodes, **ssaTranscribe** will support two key aims:
1. Scaling the SSA from ~5,000 to 35,000 labeled images featuring target `face`, `number`, `place`, and `word` object categories.
2. Curating SSA images that spotlight imaginative, stylistically diverse scenes and experiences of wonder, play, and interactive learning.

## Directory Structure

- Table of most important folder and/or file paths and where they lead (i.e., `transcriptionwithspeakersv1.py` = Main script for processing media files)

## Data Flow

- Table of input and output file 'categories' and their formats (i.e., Outputs: Transcript = `.txt` and `.json`)
- Diagram of how data are received, preprocessed (if applicable), and processed

## Implementation

- Compute requirements
- Installation instructions (packages, models, etc.)
- Configuration instructions (config files, environment variables, parameters, dependencies)
- Execution instructions
