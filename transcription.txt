[0:00:00.031 - 0:00:01.012] SPEAKER 1:
Well, hi, honey.

[0:00:01.032 - 0:00:07.541] SPEAKER 2:
How come you're so late? Well, because we had a meeting and class, went a little overtime. How's your cold?

[0:00:08.162 - 0:00:16.293] SPEAKER 3:
Oh, it's not, I don't hurt, but you know, I'm so hoarse. Yeah, it still sounds a little bit like, you know, stuffy or something like that. Yeah. Does your throat hurt at all?

[0:00:16.313 - 0:00:17.735] SPEAKER 4:
No, but I'm just very hoarse.

[0:00:19.277 - 0:00:22.842] SPEAKER 1:
Yeah. What's that? Does that sound like a trumpet to you?

[0:00:22.862 - 0:00:25.406] SPEAKER 3:
Sounds like a little hoarse, wouldn't it?

[0:00:25.426 - 0:00:26.427] SPEAKER 4:
Sounds like I feel it.

[0:00:26.727 - 0:00:29.872] SPEAKER 3:
Oh, you know what it is? It's coming from Oscar's trash can.

[0:00:29.994 - 0:00:31.759] SPEAKER 1:
Oh, no. What's he doing there?
